                                                             PROJECT IN PROGRESS

This project demonstrates the integration of cloud infrastructure (AWS) and a local computer using K3s, showing how DevOps processes can extend beyond the cloud.
I am testing a small web application generated by ChatGPT by creating four EC2 instances on AWS, which are Ansible, Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
I created these EC2 instances using Terraform.
I connected Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus to the Ansible EC2, and I will install these tools using Docker images.
Once the application passes through the Jenkins pipeline and SonarQube tests, the pipeline will push the application's Docker image to Nexus.
From there (to intentionally complicate the project), K3s will pull the Docker image onto an auxiliary computer that I connected to my laptop via a router, on which I deleted Windows, installed Linux Ubuntu, and assigned a static IP address configured via Netplan.
When K3s pulls the Docker image from Nexus, I will access the worker’s IP address to check if the application works.
Since the application is simple, accessing the worker’s IP through a browser should display “WELL DONE.”
The project started on 09.02.2026 and will be finished in a few days.
